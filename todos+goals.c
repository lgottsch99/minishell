goals for next week 29.1.:

name for team! amazing shell
get github running
do more research what is parsing + execution (what to expect from the code)
maybe implent some built ins
->get ready to split responsibility, be able to start the real deal


steps:
1. get basic working shell version (that can be used for testing too)
2. use github and work in branches on new features 
    (tips: always git pull before writing sth new, main branch should always be working)
