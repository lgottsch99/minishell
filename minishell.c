/*
A shell does three main things in its lifetime:
Initialize: 
    In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shellâ€™s behavior.
Interpret: 
    Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
Terminate: 
    After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  // Load config files, if any.

  // Run command loop.
  lsh_loop();

  // Perform any shutdown/cleanup.

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

INSIDE LOOP
REPL read evaluate print loop (loop only terminates when program is closed)
