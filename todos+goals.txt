goals for next week 29.1.:

name for team! amazing shell, Code and Chaos, Shell Shockers, Shell we?,  try again?, Shell Yeah!, Error 404: Team Name Not Found, C-affeine Break

get github running OK

OK do more research what is parsing + execution (what to expect from the code) //what about lexing? it seems to be good for parsing as well

maybe implent some built ins
->get ready to split responsibility, be able to start the real deal


steps:
1. get basic working shell version (that can be used for testing too)
2. use github and work in branches on new features
    (tips: always git pull before writing sth new, main branch should always be working)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
goals next meetup wednesday 5.2.

get started 
dana parsing + signals
lilli exec + builtins

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.2.

when to do env handling in parsing or exec? ->in parsing bc only need to handle extension. 

-> need use own env list CHANGED ENV LIST STRUCTURE A LITTLE ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26.2.
topics:

??export: quote handling possible in parsing part? export lilli=cool lilli="cool" should have same result

parsing: multiple redirections should work (eg cat<a2.txt (IN) >a3.txt > a4.txt (OUT))

$?: int exit_stat

??here doc  
	-here doc: maybe needs to be implemented in parsing: 
		if << found in input string -> separate prompt loop going on until delimiter is typed? (each line saved,...) 

to do:
	-heredoc
	-signals
	-maybe change exit nr to standard error handling??
	-display pwd somehow?? or just use pwd to prove
	-freeing: final implement after putting all parts Together -> should be ok
	-norm



debug: 
		remove t_commmand -> command ??
		parsing: 
			input: export var="sth" 
					-> not parsed like arg[0]: export, arg[1]:var="sth" (builtin export)
		running minishell in minishell?
		parsing not working with own environ list
		LILLI get path: add function of ./ (in current dir) ../ one up or ./project/minishell with path from current dir

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.2

dana:
	heredoc
	signals
	change envp in tokenizing to environ list

lilli;
	execution path thing OK
	debug run ms from within ms: OK
		when 2nd shell all env info lost OK

	freeing env
	testinggggg
