goals for next week 29.1.:

name for team! amazing shell, Code and Chaos, Shell Shockers, Shell we?,  try again?, Shell Yeah!, Error 404: Team Name Not Found, C-affeine Break

get github running OK

OK do more research what is parsing + execution (what to expect from the code) //what about lexing? it seems to be good for parsing as well

maybe implent some built ins
->get ready to split responsibility, be able to start the real deal


steps:
1. get basic working shell version (that can be used for testing too)
2. use github and work in branches on new features
    (tips: always git pull before writing sth new, main branch should always be working)

when to do env handling in parsing or exec? ->in parsing bc only need to handle extension. 

-> need use own env list CHANGED ENV LIST STRUCTURE A LITTLE

??here doc create own file??

??export quote handling possible in parsing part? export lilli=cool lilli="cool" should have same result
